# LiveNewsApp
In this Application I have used an news API. I have fetched using AJAX (you can also use fetchAPI). For designing of the Application I have used Bootstrap and HTML for skeleton.
I have used Accordion body. According is just a component of the bootstrap. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions.
You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding the default variables.
It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the .accordion-body, though the transition does limit overflow.
